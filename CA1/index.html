    <h3 id="myH3">Where is Ireland now in regards to environmental sustainability? </h3><br>
    <p2> Greenhouse gas emmisions have decreased by 1.9% since 2021, they were driven by the reductions in the Residential sector, Industry, Agriculture and Electricity generation. The overall emissions reduction, while welcome, falls short of reductions required to achieve National and new EU targets. Hopefully Ireland as a whole can work together to achiece the targets that have been set. </p2><br>
    
    <p3> In 2021, Ireland produced 3.17 million tonnes of municipal waste, which is made up of household and commercial waste. In total, 17.6 million tonnes of waste was generated in 2021, 11.9 million tonnes of this was mineral waste which consisted of soil, gravel, rock, clay, concrete, slag and ash.</p3><br>

    <h4> What is Ireland planning to do to improve on this? </h4><br>
    <p4> Ireland plan on reducing gas emmisions 4.8% yearly between 2021-2025, the budget will increase to decrease gas emmisions and plan on reducing them by 8.3% yearly between 2026-2030. There's a focus on transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and decrease emissions from the energy sector. Agriculture is a significant contributor to emissions in Ireland. The government is working on sustainable agricultural practices, including better nutrient management and promoting low-emission farming techniques.</p4><br>
    
    <p5> The government launched the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, outlining specific measures and targets to improve waste management practices. This includes reducing single-use plastics, increasing recycling rates, and minimizing landfill.</p5><br>
